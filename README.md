# MySCSSRepo

This repository contains a sample client for SCSS's IntegrationApi sample client.

## Demo Client

The `IAPI.Fis.Demo` folder contains a minimal example of a console application that uses the API to synchronize one or more users to SCView. This is primarily a test harness to ensure the client functions within CSIU's .NET Framework and dependency limitations.  

> Note: Financial DLL's must be provided in order to execute the demo.
